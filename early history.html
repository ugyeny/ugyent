    <h2>Origins of Football</h2>
    <p>Football can trace its roots back to ancient civilizations. Games involving a ball were played in various forms across the world, including ancient China, Egypt, Greece, and the Americas. However, the modern version of the game we know today began to take shape in medieval England.</p>

    <h2>The Formation of Modern Football</h2>
    <p>The birth of modern football occurred in 1863 when the Football Association (FA) was established in England. This led to the creation of standardized rules for the game, including the size of the field, the number of players, and how the game was played. The FA's rules became the foundation for the global standard of football.</p>

    <h2>International Spread of Football</h2>
    <p>After its formalization in England, football quickly spread across Europe and the rest of the world. The first international match was played in 1872 between England and Scotland. The sport gained massive popularity in countries like Brazil, Argentina, Italy, and Spain, where it became a significant part of national identity.</p>
